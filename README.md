# EcoSnap

Environmentally conscious Android application that utilizes Deep Learning to classify whether an object is recyclable or non-recyclable. 

## Project Description 

This application was created for our Android Mobile Development course to serve as the final product that allowed us to demonstrate our proficiency with the Android ecosystem. Initially our group wanted to recreate [Not Hotdog](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/not-hotdog/id1212457521?mt=8), the famous mobile app from HBOâ€™s hit [Silicon Valley](https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley), but was later influenced by a greater cause. A greater cause coming in the form of a group member that had minimum knowledge on how to recycle. His lack of knowledge was hurting the Earth, and as a result we wanted to create a solution that benefitted those who share the same lack of knowledge on recycling. This resulted in us pivoting to create an app that allowed users to utilize the camera on their phone to distinguish between objects that may or may not be recyclable.
